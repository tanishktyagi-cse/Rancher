Setting up machines/nodes


1. Go to the cluster and select registration tab over there
2. Step 1:There you can choose what roles you want to assign to the node for ex- control plane, worker node, etcd. You can assign all the roles to a node at once also. In our case we are selecting all the roles.
3. Step 2: You need to enable the insecure mode and copy the following command from there.
4. You need to run this command on the machine you want to assign as a node for your cluster.
5. After running the command you can check the progress in the machine and provision logs tab in the rancher UI by selecting the cluster.
