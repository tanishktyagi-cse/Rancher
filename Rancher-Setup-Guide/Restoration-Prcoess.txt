6. Restore Strategy 


Stop the container currently running Rancher Server on which you want to restore the data.




1. docker stop <RANCHER_CONTAINER_NAME>


2. Enter the following command to delete your current state data and replace it with your backup data that you took.


docker run  --volumes-from <RANCHER_CONTAINER_NAME> -v $PWD:/backup \
busybox sh -c "rm /var/lib/rancher/* -rf  && \
tar pzxvf /backup/rancher-data-backup-<RANCHER_VERSION>-<DATE>.tar.gz"




3. Restart your Rancher Server container, replacing the placeholder. It will restart using your backup data.


docker start <RANCHER_CONTAINER_NAME>
